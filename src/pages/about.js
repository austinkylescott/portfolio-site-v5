      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Over time I've had a lot of different interests but there are two things
        that have been constant throughout my life: a love for improvisational
        theater and deep interest in technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was exposed to both during my high school days and was able to bring
        improv comedy into my working adult life as a paid teacher and coach
        here in Gainesville, FL. I now seek to do transition into a web
        development career.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy being on the cutting edge and keeping up with technology as it
        changes. Fortunately, my previous professional work experience in retail
        management, faculty recruitment, and human resources has instilled the
        importance of balancing doing the coolest or trendiest things with doing
        what's most important: giving the customer the product they want as
        quickly as possible.
